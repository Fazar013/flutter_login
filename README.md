# Flutter Login Example

This example uses a ScrollView, JSON Rest API, Navigation, Alert Pop Up, Progress Indicator, Globals, Images in a shared asset folder, and 100% Shared Code. Now with the ability to create a new pin code, verify existing one, login with FaceID, TouchID, and Fingerprint Reader on Android. 

## Getting Started

Clone or Fork Project to get started.

### Prerequisites

Flutter SDK, Android Studio or Other Compatible IDE.

#### iOS Integration

Note that this plugin works with both TouchID and FaceID. However, to use the latter,
you need to also add:

```
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>Why is my app authenticating using face id?</string>
```

to your Info.plist file. Failure to do so results in a dialog that tells the user your
app has not been updated to use TouchID.


#### Android Integration

Update your project's `AndroidManifest.xml` file to include the
`USE_FINGERPRINT` permissions:

```
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          package="com.example.app">
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT"/>
<manifest>
```

#### Sticky Auth

You can set the `stickyAuth` option on the plugin to true so that plugin does not
return failure if the app is put to background by the system. This might happen
if the user receives a phone call before they get a chance to authenticate. With
`stickyAuth` set to false, this would result in plugin returning failure result
to the Dart app. If set to true, the plugin will retry authenticating when the
app resumes.
